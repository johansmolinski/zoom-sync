Sync Generator for Zoom R8
=

Arduino based sync generator for Zoom R8. I use this for tempo synchronization with my Arturia Minibrute 2S, but other equipment able to listen for sync pulses should also be able to utilize it. This solution could possibly be adopted to other hosts than the R8 as well.

Missing instructions on building and interfacing with hardware. Please open an issue if interested and I hope to schedule for some instructions. :)
